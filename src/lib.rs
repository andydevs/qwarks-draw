//! Jarsdraw — a Rust/WebAssembly canvas drawing library for the browser.
//!
//! Compiled to WASM via `wasm-bindgen`, this crate exposes drawing primitives
//! that operate on the HTML5 Canvas API through `web-sys`.
//!
//! - [`Canvas`] wraps a `<canvas>` element and its 2D rendering context.
//! - [`Draw`] is implemented by anything that can render itself onto a [`Canvas`].
//! - [`Polyline`] is a connected-line-segment [`Draw`] primitive.
//! - [`Circle`] is a fillable/strokeable circle [`Draw`] primitive.
//! - [`Line`] is a fillable/strokeable single-segment [`Draw`] primitive.
//! - [`Styled`] add chainable stroke styling on top of a [`Draw`] primitive.
